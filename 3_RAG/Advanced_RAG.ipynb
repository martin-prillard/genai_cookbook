Unfortunately, during the interview, he fell asleep on the keyboard, accidentally sending a company-wide email that said, 'Meow if you approve!' Surprisingly, the staff loved it, thinking it was a new motivational strategy. Mr. Jonas got the promotion, now supervising the office naps. Soon, he implemented 'cat breaks' every hour, where employees were encouraged to stretch, purr softly, or chase imaginary laser pointers. Productivity oddly skyrocketed, and the office became famous for its feline-inspired efficiency seminars. Mr. Jonas even started a newsletter titled 'The Purr-fect Manager,' sharing tips on balancing work and naps.\"\"\",\n",

One morning, the toast said, 'Beware the dancing squirrels at 3 PM!' She ignored it, and sure enough, a flash mob of squirrels waltzed through her garden, all wearing tiny top hats. Jenny now always eats her breakfast with a helmet. Eventually, she discovered a secret lever inside the toaster that allowed her to send messages back in time. She used it to warn her past self about spilled coffee, missed deadlines, and unexpected squirrel invasions. Breakfast became an adventure, with toast revealing mysteries of the universe and sometimes giving advice on what socks to wear for luck.\"\"\",\n",

One ambitious dog named Max decided to chase the falling spaghetti like a game. Soon, the whole town joined, slipping, sliding, and twirling in a chaotic noodle dance-off. By evening, everyone agreed: it was the tastiest disaster in history. Over the next few days, chefs experimented with sky-spaghetti recipes, inventing noodle ice cream, spaghetti smoothies, and pasta hats. Scientists tried to figure out the phenomenon but concluded it was 'spaghetti magic.'

    "## 2️⃣ Parent/Child Chunking Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The **ParentDocumentRetriever** implements a sophisticated two-level chunking strategy that addresses the classic trade-off between retrieval precision and context completeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Child chunks** (smaller, ~250 tokens)\n",
    "  - Used for initial retrieval via vector similarity search\n",
    "  - Provides fine-grained matching for precise passage retrieval\n",
    "  - Better semantic alignment with specific query aspects\n",
    "  - Enables finding needle-in-haystack information\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Parent chunks** (larger, ~800 tokens)\n",
    "  - Retrieved automatically when a child chunk matches\n",
    "  - Provides broader context around the matched passage\n",
    "  - Reduces context fragmentation and improves answer coherence\n",
    "  - Maintains narrative flow and related information\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Ideal for:**\n",
    "- Documents with dense information where context matters\n",
    "- Long-form content (articles, reports, documentation)\n",
    "- Scenarios requiring both precision and completeness\n",
    "- Applications where answer quality depends on surrounding context\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Less suitable for:**\n",
    "- Very short documents or FAQ-style content\n",
    "- Real-time systems with strict latency requirements\n",
    "- Simple Q&A where exact matches are sufficient\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this section does:**\n",
    "- Initializes OpenAI embeddings (`text-embedding-3-small`)\n",
    "- Creates a Qdrant vector store (in-memory for this demo)\n",
    "- Sets up the `ParentDocumentRetriever` with:\n",
    "  - **Child splitter**: Small chunks (~250 tokens) for precise retrieval\n",
    "  - **Parent splitter**: Larger chunks (~800 tokens) for context\n",
    "- Indexes the documents using the parent/child strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concept:** The retriever stores child chunks in the vector store for retrieval, but returns parent chunks to provide broader context.\n"

    "## 🔄 RAG Pipeline Funnel: From BM25 to Final Reranking\n",
    "\n",
    "This section demonstrates the **funnel operation** of a multi-stage RAG pipeline, showing how documents are progressively filtered and refined from initial frequency-based retrieval to final reranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Funnel Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "A RAG funnel progressively narrows down the document set through multiple retrieval stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐\n",
    "│  Stage 1: BM25 (Frequency-based)        │\n",
    "│  → Broad retrieval using term frequency │\n",
    "│  → Returns: ~20-30 documents            │\n",
    "└─────────────────────────────────────────┘\n",
    "              ↓\n",
    "┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐\n",
    "│  Stage 2: Vector Similarity (Semantic)   │\n",
    "│  → Semantic matching using embeddings   │\n",
    "│  → Returns: ~8-10 documents             │\n",
    "└─────────────────────────────────────────┘\n",
    "              ↓\n",
    "┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐\n",
    "│  Stage 3: LLM Reranking                  │\n",
    "│  → Contextual relevance scoring          │\n",
    "│  → Returns: ~3-5 final documents         │\n",
    "└─────────────────────────────────────────┘\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Use a Funnel?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- ✅ **Efficiency**: BM25 is fast and catches keyword matches\n",
    "- ✅ **Recall**: Initial broad retrieval ensures nothing is missed\n",
    "- ✅ **Precision**: Each stage refines results for better relevance\n",
    "- ✅ **Cost Optimization**: Expensive LLM reranking only on top candidates\n",
    "- ✅ **Hybrid Approach**: Combines lexical (BM25) and semantic (vector) signals\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trade-offs:**\n",
    "- ⚠️ More complex pipeline with multiple stages\n",
    "- ⚠️ Requires tuning of k values at each stage\n",
    "- ⚠️ May filter out relevant documents if stages are too aggressive\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this section does:**\n",
    "- Implements BM25 retrieval using frequency-based term matching\n",
    "- Demonstrates the funnel operation with visual output\n",
    "- Shows document counts and snippets at each stage\n",

    "## 4️⃣ RAG-Fusion Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement **RAG-Fusion**, a technique that combines query expansion with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to significantly improve recall. **RAG-Fusion** is a powerful technique that combines query expansion with result fusion to significantly improve recall, especially on heterogeneous or complex corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Core Components\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Query Expansion**\n",
    "- Generates diverse reformulations of the original question\n",
    "- Captures different phrasings, perspectives, and semantic variations\n",
    "- Helps retrieve documents that might be missed by the original query\n",
    "- Example: \"What is RAG?\" → [\"Explain RAG\", \"How does retrieval-augmented generation work?\", \"Describe RAG systems\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**\n",
    "- Merges results from multiple queries using a mathematical formula\n",
    "- **Formula**: `score = Σ(1 / (k + rank))` across all query results\n",
    "- Documents appearing in multiple result sets receive higher scores\n",
    "- Naturally promotes consensus documents (documents relevant to multiple query variations)\n",
    "- The constant `k` (typically 60) prevents division by zero and smooths the ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Particularly effective for:**\n",
    "- Heterogeneous corpora with varied document types\n",
    "- Ambiguous queries that could be interpreted multiple ways\n",
    "- Multi-domain knowledge bases\n",
    "- Scenarios where recall is more important than precision\n",
    "- Complex questions requiring information from multiple perspectives\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **May be overkill for:**\n",
    "- Simple, well-defined queries\n",
    "- Homogeneous document collections\n",
    "- Systems with strict latency constraints\n",
    "- Very specific, unambiguous questions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this section does:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query Expansion\n",
    "- `query_expansions()`: Generates multiple reformulations of the original query\n",
    "- Uses an LLM to create diverse phrasings that capture different aspects of the question\n",
    "- Helps retrieve documents that might be missed by the original query\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)\n",
    "- `reciprocal_rank_fusion()`: Merges results from multiple queries\n",
    "- **Formula**: `score = Σ(1 / (k + rank))` across all query result sets\n",
    "- Documents appearing in multiple result sets get higher scores\n",
    "- Naturally promotes consensus documents (documents relevant to multiple query variations)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Search Function\n",
    "- `search_once()`: Performs a single retrieval using the parent/child retriever\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- Significantly improves recall on heterogeneous corpora\n",
    "- Handles ambiguous queries effectively\n",
    "- Captures information from multiple perspectives\n"

    "\n",
    "✅ **Best for complex questions requiring:**\n",
    "- Multiple retrieval queries (e.g., \"Compare X and Y\")\n",
    "- Sequential reasoning (e.g., \"First find A, then use A to find B\")\n",
