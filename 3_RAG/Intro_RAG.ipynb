    "- Understand the core concepts of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)\n",
    "- Implement a basic RAG pipeline using LangChain\n",

    "\n",
    "**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a technique that combines:\n",
    "1. **Retrieval**: Finding relevant information from a knowledge base\n",
    "2. **Augmentation**: Injecting this context into the prompt\n",
    "3. **Generation**: Using a language model to generate answers based on the retrieved context\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach improves factual accuracy and reduces hallucinations by grounding the model's responses in actual documents.\n"

Unfortunately, during the interview, he fell asleep on the keyboard, accidentally sending a company-wide email that said, 'Meow if you approve!' Surprisingly, the staff loved it, thinking it was a new motivational strategy. Mr. Jonas got the promotion, now supervising the office naps. Soon, he implemented 'cat breaks' every hour, where employees were encouraged to stretch, purr softly, or chase imaginary laser pointers. Productivity oddly skyrocketed, and the office became famous for its feline-inspired efficiency seminars. Mr. Jonas even started a newsletter titled 'The Purr-fect Manager,' sharing tips on balancing work and naps.\"\"\",\n",

One morning, the toast said, 'Beware the dancing squirrels at 3 PM!' She ignored it, and sure enough, a flash mob of squirrels waltzed through her garden, all wearing tiny top hats. Jenny now always eats her breakfast with a helmet. Eventually, she discovered a secret lever inside the toaster that allowed her to send messages back in time. She used it to warn her past self about spilled coffee, missed deadlines, and unexpected squirrel invasions. Breakfast became an adventure, with toast revealing mysteries of the universe and sometimes giving advice on what socks to wear for luck.\"\"\",\n",

One ambitious dog named Max decided to chase the falling spaghetti like a game. Soon, the whole town joined, slipping, sliding, and twirling in a chaotic noodle dance-off. By evening, everyone agreed: it was the tastiest disaster in history. Over the next few days, chefs experimented with sky-spaghetti recipes, inventing noodle ice cream, spaghetti smoothies, and pasta hats. Scientists tried to figure out the phenomenon but concluded it was 'spaghetti magic.' Max became the town hero, leading annual 'noodle festivals,' and Noodleton transformed into the world's first pasta-themed tourist destination.\"\"\"\n",

    "#### What happens if `chunk_size` is too small? Too large?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If `chunk_size` is too small:**  \n",
    "  - **Pros:** Each chunk is very focused, minimizing irrelevant information.  \n",
    "  - **Cons:** Important context can be lost because sentences/paragraphs are split. Retrieval may return partial or incoherent answers.  \n",
    "  - **Performance:** Number of chunks increases → more memory/storage usage and slower embedding/search.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If `chunk_size` is too large:**  \n",
    "  - **Pros:** More context is preserved in each chunk, helping the model produce complete answers.  \n",
    "  - **Cons:** Irrelevant text may be included, which can confuse retrieval.  \n",
    "  - **Performance:** Fewer chunks → faster embedding, but long chunks may exceed the model’s token limit during retrieval/generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule of thumb:** Choose chunks that fit comfortably within your LLM’s context window (e.g., 500–1000 tokens for GPT-3.5/GPT-4 small tasks).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How does `chunk_overlap` affect retrieval quality?\n",
    "\n",
    "- `chunk_overlap` defines how many tokens/characters are shared between consecutive chunks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Higher overlap:**  \n",
    "  - **Pros:** Preserves context across chunk boundaries → improves retrieval for multi-sentence queries.  \n",
    "  - **Cons:** More redundant chunks → slightly higher storage and embedding costs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lower overlap:**  \n",
    "  - **Pros:** Less redundancy → faster processing and lower storage.  \n",
    "  - **Cons:** May lose context at chunk boundaries → retrieval can miss important information.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:** Typical overlap is 50–100 tokens (~20–30% of chunk size).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What's the optimal chunk size for your use case?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Depends on:**  \n",
    "  - Document type (dense technical PDFs vs. short news articles)  \n",
    "  - Query complexity (simple fact lookup vs. multi-sentence reasoning)  \n",
    "  - LLM context window (e.g., GPT-4 has 8k–32k tokens)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical guideline:**  \n",
    "- Start with:  \n",
    "  - `chunk_size = 500–1000 tokens`  \n",
    "  - `chunk_overlap = 50–100 tokens`  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Test retrieval quality:  \n",
    "  - If answers are incomplete → increase chunk size or overlap.  \n",
    "  - If answers include too much irrelevant info → decrease chunk size.  \n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Extra tip:** Visualize a few chunks to ensure they contain coherent, self-contained information. This is often the easiest way to find the “sweet spot.”\n"
